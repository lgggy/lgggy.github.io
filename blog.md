### KG Embedding with Rules
* Jointly Embedding Knowledge Graphs and Logical Rules[EMNLP'2016]

  It represents and models triples and rules in a unified framework. Triples are represented as atomic formulae which modeled by the translation assumption, which rules as complex formulae which modeled by the t-norm fuzzy logics.
